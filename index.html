            <p>Hello.</p>
            <p>My name is Yauheni Kireyeu and I am software developer from Minsk, Belarus.</p>
            <p>I've been working in IT since 2011.
            First 6 years I principally worked as a C++ developer with orientation on Windows platform though from time to time I made some platform specific work on macOS and Linux. These years I faced with such technologies like MFC, WinAPI, Qt, STL, ATL, MSXML, libxml2, libxslt, Lex, Yacc.</p>
            <p>There were some specific tasks working on which I wrote code on Perl (custom build system) and C# (Visual Studio Extension for custom language), investigated possibility to migrate solution to AWS, prepared migration of solution from 32 bit to 64 bit platform, refactored custom SQL parsers, etc.</p>
            <p>For some time I participated in migration the solution from C++ to node.js and then I've decided to try myself as a full stack developer.
            So now I have 3+ years experience of JS full stack development and ready to reach new horizons.</p>
            <p>I worked in waterfall and Scrum, as a developer as well as a team leader.
            I'm interested in learning new programming paradigms and glad to apply my knowledge into practice.
            For these years I've conducted more than 50 interviews and it would be great to increase this number at least to 100.</p>
